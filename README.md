## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:
1. Created consts
2. Created a function that shows errors on a website
3. Created a function that set my website to default mode (clears error)
4. Created a function that validate my email input (regexp + .test)
5. Created a function that checks if my input is empty (show errors if it is)
6. Created a function that clear my input field and console log my email if I submit correct data
7. Created event on a button
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I managed to do this challenge in 9,5 hours. Unfortunately, adding proper JavaScript code took me 6,5h, but I'm proud of my job. It's my first JS code that I used in my task and seems to work good.
